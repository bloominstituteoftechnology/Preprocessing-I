    <h3><span><strong>Listen Up . . .</strong></span></h3>
   <p>Growing up I was all about sports and video games. In Highschool I took a computer programming class that planted the seed of coding in me. It wasn't until this year, 2019, when I finally decided to try something I remembered enjoying!</p>

    <h3><span><strong>Work History</strong></span></h3>
   <p>While I was in college, I worked at a trampoline gym similar to Sky High. I worked as a party host which meant I was in charge of hosting the parties that customers would buy. In highschool I helped my friend with his hotdog cart here and there for some extra cash.</p>

         <li>Piano - I started playing piano when I was about 10 years old.</li>
         <li>Guitar - like piano, I played at a young age so I am probably very Rusty!</li>
