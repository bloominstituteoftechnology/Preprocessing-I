      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="tagline">Hi, my name is Rahul Desai. I'm a jack of all trades who can quickly problem-solve across disciplines. In fact, my first name means "efficient" in Sanskrit.
      <p class="tagline">I'm currently learning full-stack web engineering at Lambda School, with an eye towards eventually becoming a Technical Product Manager. In undergrad, I studied Business with a concentration in Operations &amp; Information Management and a minor in English.</p> 
      <p class="tagline">I love innovations that draw insight from messy, massive data-sets (e.g. medical records, purchasing behavior) and have previously set strategy for, designed, and built products in this vein. I'm interested in working on similar things in the future.</p>
