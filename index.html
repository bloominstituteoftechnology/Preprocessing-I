<h3>Intro:</h3>

<p>Hello! I'm Jashele, a Phoenix, AZ based Full Stack Developer who is passionate about writing clean & functional code + building user-friendly products. I began my journey as a developer in 2003 as a self-taught learner of HTML, CSS & Wordpress. In 2013, I received an Associate Degree in Computer Programming Technology where I gained exposure to programming in Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual C# and Java. My professional background includes various technical support roles in addition to personally staying up to date with the world of software development. Currently, I am enrolled as a full-time Software Engineering student online at Lambda School working to transition into a career in Software Development.</p>
