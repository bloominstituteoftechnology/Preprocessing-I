      <h1 class="title">Rick Sanchez - Genius Scientist</h1>
      <h2 class="phrase">Wubba lubba dub-dub!</h2>
      <p class="content">Rick is a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, and the world's first amusement park inside the body of a living human. His brilliance can be muddled by his jaded personal views and his alcoholic tendencies. Rick is easily bored and does not do well with routine.</p>
