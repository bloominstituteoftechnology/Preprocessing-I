# Preprocessing
Preprocessing extends the ability of CSS by adding abstractions and making CSS easier to use. There are many flavors of preprocessors but the one we will focus on will be LESS (Leaner Style Sheets).  LESS is a language extension for CSS.  It fits nicely into almost every type of development stack and has been ported to JavaScript among many other programming languages. http://lesscss.org/
